[Urban Dictionary][] is great. But, it's missing an API. So, this provides one.

This was [originally built to provide a data source for a an extension to the Mac
quick launch tool][post], [Alfred][]. It allowed you to request a definition which
would then be returned back to you. Alfred 2 changed the way extensions worked, and 
so UrbanScraper gained a few new methods, allowing the workflow to give 'live'
results.

The [live version][] is hosted on [Heroku][]. It's a simple [Sinatra][] application, 
using [Nokogiri][] for HTML/XML parsing. [MiniTest][] and [VCR][] are used for
testing and mocking web requests respectively.

## Usage

It is targeted against Ruby 2.0. You'll also need [Bundler][].

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec ruby app.rb
```

Tests can be run using `rake`:

```bash
rake test
```
